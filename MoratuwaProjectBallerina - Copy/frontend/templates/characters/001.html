    <h1>Oh Il-nam (Player 001)</h1>
    <p><em>Oh Il-nam, known as Player 001, is the oldest participant in <strong>Squid Game</strong> and one of the most mysterious characters in the series. Initially perceived as a fragile and harmless old man, his character arc leads to one of the most shocking twists in the show’s climax.</em></p>

    <h2>Background and Personality</h2>
    <p><span class="highlight">Il-nam</span> enters the game claiming to be terminally ill with a brain tumor, stating that he joined the competition to feel alive one last time. His warm, grandfatherly nature and cheerful attitude make him instantly likable among players and viewers alike. Despite his age and condition, he participates eagerly and displays surprising energy and insight into the games and people around him.</p>

    <h2>Appearance and Demeanor</h2>
    <p>Il-nam is a frail man with a gentle smile and soft-spoken manner. His behavior is often playful and nostalgic, even in the face of danger. He displays a childlike joy during certain games, especially Red Light, Green Light and marbles, which ties deeply into the show’s symbolism about innocence, memory, and life itself. He seems harmless — almost too harmless.</p>

    <h2>Role in the Game</h2>
    <p>As Player 001, Il-nam becomes closely bonded with Seong Gi-hun, acting as a fatherly figure and emotional anchor. He contributes to his team in the tug-of-war game with unexpected strategy and confidence. However, his most impactful scene is during the marble game, where his vulnerability and memory loss manipulate the audience into deep sympathy — only for the truth to later unravel.</p>

    <h2>Strengths and Skills</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Highly intelligent and observant</li>
      <li>Master manipulator behind a gentle facade</li>
      <li>Deep understanding of the games and their structure</li>
      <li>Capable of feigning weakness to gain trust</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Impact on the Story</h2>
    <p><span class="highlight">Oh Il-nam</span> is eventually revealed to be one of the creators of the Squid Game — the true mastermind who helped design the entire event. His participation was a twisted personal experiment, driven by boredom and a desire to relive childhood games with real stakes. This revelation redefines every interaction he had, from his manipulation of trust to his chilling detachment from the human suffering around him. His final conversation with Gi-hun serves as a philosophical reflection on power, morality, and human nature — ending his arc with profound ambiguity and impact.</p>
