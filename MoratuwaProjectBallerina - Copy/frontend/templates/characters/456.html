    <h1>Seong Gi-hun (Player 456)</h1>
    <p><em>Seong Gi-hun, also known as Player 456, is the central character and emotional heart of the <strong>Squid Game</strong> series. His journey through the deadly games is as much about personal redemption as it is about survival and desperation. A flawed but deeply human character, he embodies both the failures and hopes of everyday people facing a cruel system.</em></p>

    <h2>Background and Personality</h2>
    <p><span class="highlight">Gi-hun</span> begins the story as a man struggling with debt, unemployment, and a strained relationship with his daughter. Once a factory worker, he’s now a gambling addict who lives with his elderly mother and can barely support himself. Despite his flaws, Gi-hun is shown to be kind-hearted, empathetic, and morally conflicted — a man who has lost his way but not his soul.</p>

    <h2>Appearance and Demeanor</h2>
    <p>He’s portrayed as an everyman with unkempt hair, casual clothing, and a look of weariness and disappointment. In the games, his appearance gradually shifts from clumsy and carefree to serious and hardened. His expressions often reflect the mental toll the games take on him as he wrestles with impossible moral choices.</p>

    <h2>Role in the Game</h2>
    <p>As Player 456 — the last to join — Gi-hun’s arc reflects the transformation from a desperate man to a reluctant hero. He survives the games not through aggression but through empathy, cleverness, and sometimes sheer luck. His connections with other players like Ali, Sae-byeok, and Il-nam reveal his deep humanity in a system designed to strip it away.</p>

    <h2>Strengths and Skills</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Empathetic and emotionally intelligent</li>
      <li>Resourceful under pressure</li>
      <li>Strong moral compass, even when tested</li>
      <li>Capable of leadership and forming bonds</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Impact on the Story</h2>
    <p><span class="highlight">Seong Gi-hun</span> ultimately becomes more than just a survivor — he becomes a symbol of resistance. After winning the game and facing the hollow truth behind it, he struggles with guilt, trauma, and the question of what to do with his prize. His final decision to confront the game's creators rather than escape with his winnings sets up a deeper moral narrative and possibly, a future rebellion. His transformation is both tragic and empowering.</p>
