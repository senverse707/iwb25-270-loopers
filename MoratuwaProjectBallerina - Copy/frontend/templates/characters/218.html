    <h1>Cho Sang-woo (Player 218)</h1>
    <p><em>Cho Sang-woo, also known as Player 218, is one of the most complex and morally ambiguous characters in <strong>Squid Game</strong>. Once celebrated as a financial genius from Seoul National University, he joins the deadly competition after his life collapses under the weight of massive debt, fraud, and betrayal.</em></p>

    <h2>Background and Personality</h2>
    <p><span class="highlight">Sang-woo</span> is the childhood friend of Seong Gi-hun and the pride of their neighborhood for his academic success. However, behind his prestigious image lies a man burdened by financial crimes and the shame of his downfall. He enters the game not only out of desperation but to reclaim a sense of control. He is calm, calculating, and deeply pragmatic—often making brutal decisions in the name of survival.</p>

    <h2>Appearance and Demeanor</h2>
    <p>He presents himself as intelligent and composed, with a reserved demeanor and sharp eyes that constantly assess others. Unlike more physically aggressive players, Sang-woo's strength lies in his intellect. However, as the game progresses, his composed image begins to fracture, revealing the fear and moral decay underneath.</p>

    <h2>Role in the Game</h2>
    <p>Player 218 plays a critical strategic role in multiple games, often leveraging his knowledge to survive. While he starts off as a cooperative team member, he gradually descends into cold pragmatism. His betrayal of players like Ali marks a major turning point in the story, making him one of the most controversial figures in the series. Sang-woo embodies the painful reality of moral compromise in a cruel system.</p>

    <h2>Strengths and Skills</h2>

      <li>Highly intelligent and analytical</li>
      <li>Strategically manipulative</li>
      <li>Calm under pressure</li>
      <li>Emotionally restrained and goal-focused</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Impact on the Story</h2>
    <p><span class="highlight">Cho Sang-woo</span> is a tragic figure—his fall from grace and transformation into a morally grey player is both heartbreaking and enraging. He is not purely evil, but his actions raise questions about the cost of survival and the weight of guilt. His final moments, filled with regret and redemption, add depth to his character arc and leave a lasting impression on both the audience and Gi-hun.</p>
